## Instructions
When start the application, there are two options, logging in by exist account or registering a new account. If you are the first time using it, you can try to register a new account, such as username: 111, password: 222. Then, you can log in with this account. If you log in with an account that has never been registered, it will say “Please Log again!”

Once logged in, list of events sent by other users will showed in the screen. If you have already used a certain account to post events, you will see list of events. If you see nothing on screen, it indicates the data in database has been cleared, now you can post an event (see in next bullet point). After you post an event successfully, you can see it not only with current account, but also another new registered account.

The personal event can be posted from yourself by clicking cross button at top right corner. You can post an event by filling the title, some words, and location (Such as 827 S Carpenter, Chicago, IL 60607). You can add photo by clicking camera image.

The likes and comment can be added under each event.
